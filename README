NAME
    Queue::Base - Simple OO style queue implementation.

VERSION
    version 2.203

SYNOPSIS
        use Queue::Base;

        # construction
        my $queue = new Queue::Base;
        # or
        my $queue = new Queue::Base(\@elements);

        # add a new element to the queue
        $queue->add($element);

        # remove the next element from the queue
        if (! $queue->empty) {
            my $element = $queue->remove;
        }

        # or
        $element = $queue->remove;
        if (defined $element) {
            # do some processing here
        }

        # add/remove more than just one element
        $queue->add($elem1, $elem2 ...)
        # and
        @elements = $queue->remove(5);

DESCRIPTION
    The Queue::Base is a simple implementation for queue structures using an
    OO interface. Provides basic functionality: nothing less - nothing more.

METHODS
  new [ELEMENTS]
    Creates a new empty queue.

    ELEMENTS is an array reference with elements the queue to be initialized
    with.

  add [LIST_OF_ELEMENTS]
    Adds the LIST OF ELEMENTS to the end of the queue.

  remove [NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS]
    In scalar context it returns the first element from the queue.

    In array context it attempts to return NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS requested;
    when NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS is not given, it defaults to 1.

  remove_all
    Returns an array with all the elements in the queue, and clears the
    queue.

  size
    Returns the size of the queue.

  empty
    Returns whether the queue is empty, which means its size is 0.

  clear
    Removes all elements from the queue.

  copy_elem
    Returns a copy (shallow) of the underlying array with the queue
    elements.

  peek
    Returns the value of the first element of the queue, wihtout removing
    it.

CAVEATS
    The module works only with scalar values. If you want to use more
    complex structures (and there's a big change you want that) please use
    references, which in perl5 are basically scalars.

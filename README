NAME
    Queue::Base - Simple OO style queue implementation.

VERSION
    version 2.201

SYNOPSIS
        use Queue::Base;

        # construction
        my $queue = new Queue::Base;
        # or
        my $queue = new Queue::Base(\@elements);

        # add a new element to the queue
        $queue->add($element);

        # remove the next element from the queue
        if (! $queue->empty) {
            my $element = $queue->remove;
        }

        # or
        $element = $queue->remove;
        if (defined $element) {
            # do some processing here
        }

        # add/remove more than just one element
        $queue->add($elem1, $elem2 ...)
        # and
        @elements = $queue->remove(5);

DESCRIPTION
    The Queue::Base is a simple implementation for queue structures using an
    OO interface. Provides basic functionality: nothing less - nothing more.

METHODS
  Constructor
    new [ELEMENTS]
        Creates a new empty queue.

        ELEMENTS is an array reference with elements the queue to be
        initialized with.

  Methods
    add [LIST_OF_ELEMENTS]
        Adds the LIST OF ELEMENTS to the end of the queue.

    remove [NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS]
        In scalar context it returns the first element from the queue.

        In array context it attempts to return NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS requested;
        when NUMBER_OF_ELEMENTS is not given, it defaults to 1.

    remove_all
        Returns an array with all the elements in the queue, and clears the
        queue.

    size
        Returns the size of the queue.

    empty
        Returns whether the queue is empty, which means its size is 0.

    clear
        Removes all elements from the queue.

CAVEATS
    The module works only with scalar values. If you want to use more
    complex structures (and there's a big change you want that) please use
    references, which in perl5 are basically scalars.
